# RecommendSystem

This is an off-line Recommend System by using collaborative filtering and dataset of moiveLen 100.

I implement two version, one is based on KNN, and the other is based on gradient descent. Both of them are using person similarity as the criterion.

Then I use MSE and MAE to meassure the performance. And find the recommend system combined with KNN and pearson would get better evaluation.

For more infomation about the whole project and summary, please see README, and report.pdf.
